    <h1 id="about-me"> About Me </h1> 
    <p> I was gifted to this world on June 7, 2001 in Clevalnd, Ohio. My family moved away from Ohio when I was around 16 months old.
        Since we arrived in Georgia, we have also moved around several times. Currently we are living in a neighboorhead around 45 miles north of Atlanta. </p>
    <h1 id="education"> Education </h1> 
    <p> Although I didn't always like school growing up, I have also enjoyed learning new things about the world and other people
        which pushed to start appreciating my education more once I got to high school. The subjects that I liked the most was always math or science.
        I graduated high school in summer 2019 and am heading into my second year as a copmuter science major at the University of Georgia. </p>

    <p> I first started working when I was 17 years old at Banana Republic. I stayed for a year until I left for college. 
	At UGA, I started a job working for the web team for the College of Agricultre and Enviornmental Science. 
        I had to pause my work here to have time for my STEP internship over the summer, and will resume working there in August. </p>
    <h1 id="random-facts"> Random Facts </h1>
    <p> Whenever someone asks for a fun fact, my go to response is how I've broken both of my arms. Once when I was on a skateboard and once when I was on a bike.
        One thing that others point in me is how I can remember the tiniest things.
