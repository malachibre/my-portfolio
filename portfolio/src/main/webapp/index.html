<p>I was born on world on June 7, 2001 in Clevalnd, Ohio. My family
   moved away from Ohio when I was around 16 months old. Since we arrived in
   Georgia, we have also moved around several times. Currently we are living
   in a neighboorhead around 45 miles north of Atlanta.
<h1 id="education">Education</h1>
<p>Although I didn't always like school growing up,
   I have also enjoyed learning new things about the world and other people
   which pushed to start appreciating my education more once I got to high school.
   The subjects that I liked the most was always math or science.
   I graduated high school in summer 2019 and am heading into
   my second year as a copmuter science major at the University of Georgia.

<p>I first started working when I was 17 years old at Banana Republic.
   I stayed for a year until I left for college.
   At UGA, I started a job working for the web team for the
   College of Agricultre and Enviornmental Science.
   I had to pause my work here to have time for my STEP internship over the
   summer, and will resume working there in August.
<h1 id="random-facts">Random Facts</h1>
<p>Whenever someone asks for a fun fact, my go to response is
   how I've broken both of my arms.
   Once when I was on a skateboard and once when I was on a bike.
   One thing that others point out is how I can remember the tiniest details about things.
