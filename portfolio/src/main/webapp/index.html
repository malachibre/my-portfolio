    <p class="content-text" id="about-me-text">I was born on world on June 7, 2001 in Clevalnd, Ohio. My family  
      moved away from Ohio when I was around 16 months old. Since we  
      arrived in Georgia, we have also moved around several times. 
      Currently we are living in a neighboorhead around 45 miles 
      north of Atlanta.</p>
    <h3 class="content-title" id="education-title">Education</h3>
    <p class="content-text" id="education-text"> Although I didn't always like school growing up,  
      I have also enjoyed learning new things about the world  
      and other people which pushed to start appreciating my  
      education more once I got to high school. The subjects I  
      liked the most were always math or science. I graduated   
      high school in summer 2019 and am heading into my  
      second year as a copmuter science major at the  
      University of Georgia. </p>

    <p class="content-text" id="professional-text">I first started working when I was 17 years old at Banana Republic.  
      I stayed for a year until I left for college. At UGA, 
      I started a job working for the web team for the  
      College of Agricultre and Enviornmental Science.  
      I had to pause my work here to have time for my STEP internship over  
    the summer, and will resume working there in August..</p>
    <h3 class="content-title" id="facts-title">Random Facts</h3>
    <p class="content-text" id="facts-text">Whenever someone asks for a fun fact, my go to response is how  
      I've broken both of my arms. Once when I was on a skateboard  
      and once when I was on a bike. One thing that others point  
      out is how I can remember the tiniest details about things.</p>
