      <h3 class="content-title" id="education-title">Education</h3>
      <p class="content-text" id="education-text"> Although I didn't always like school growing up,  
        I have also enjoyed learning new things about the world  
        and other people which pushed to start appreciating my  
        education more once I got to high school. The subjects I  
        liked the most were always math or science. I graduated   
        high school in summer 2019 and am heading into my  
        second year as a computer science major at the  
        University of Georgia.

      <p class="content-text" id="professional-text">I first started working when I was 17 years old at Banana Republic.  
        I stayed for a year until I left for college. At UGA, 
        I started a job working for the web team for the  
        College of Agricultre and Environmental Science.  
        I had to pause my work here to have time for my STEP internship over  
        the summer, and will resume working there in August.

      <h3 class="content-title" id="facts-title">Random Facts</h3>
      <p class="content-text" id="facts-text">Whenever someone asks for a fun fact, my go to response is how  
        I've broken both of my arms. Once when I was on a skateboard  
        and once when I was on a bike. One thing that others point  
        out is how I can remember the tiniest details about things.
